## Credits & Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) developed by Microsoft.
This is **not a fork** but a lightweight custom version built for my own needs, removing parts that were not essential for deployment or containerization.
Respect and thanks to the original developers for their excellent work!
